## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Control-plane deliveries SHALL preserve typed outbound payloads across queue and replay
The system SHALL preserve the canonical typed outbound delivery envelope when a message is queued for a Bridge instance, replayed after reconnect, or acknowledged through the control-plane cursor. Control-plane routing and replay MUST retain rich payload shape, reply-target context, and fallback metadata instead of collapsing the delivery to a text-only `content` field.

#### Scenario: Targeted delivery reaches the Bridge with typed payload intact
- **WHEN** the backend queues a signed delivery containing structured or provider-native payload for a specific `bridge_id`
- **THEN** the control plane routes that typed delivery to the targeted Bridge instance without flattening it to text
- **AND** the Bridge applies the same payload shape during delivery resolution that the backend originally queued

#### Scenario: Reconnect replay preserves rich payload fidelity
- **WHEN** a Bridge reconnects after rich or mutable deliveries were queued while it was offline
- **THEN** replay resumes from the last acknowledged cursor using the same typed delivery envelope
- **AND** the replayed delivery still contains the structured/native payload, reply target, and fallback metadata needed for the correct provider-native update path

#### Scenario: Duplicate ack suppresses the same typed delivery
- **WHEN** a Bridge acknowledges a typed delivery cursor and later reconnect logic encounters the same delivery again
- **THEN** the control plane suppresses the duplicate replay using the delivery cursor and identifier
- **AND** users do not receive a second copy of the same rich or terminal delivery
